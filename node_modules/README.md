Imagine you want to buy a drink, but
- you have to be older than 18 years
- the product should be available
- the shop should be open
let userAge;
let products = ["Beer", "Wine", "Vodka"];
let isProductAvailable;
let isShopOpen = true;
let canBuy;
 ask for age
choose a product through numbers (index)
display "Here you go" if all the condition are satisfied, otherwise "Sorry, you can't buy" (use ternary operator)
